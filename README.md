# DataCamp | Predicting Movie Rental Durations

This project is part of the **Associate Data Scientist in Python** career track on DataCamp. The data is split into an 80/20 training and test set. The target variable is "days," which is a non-negative integer. We begin by fitting a baseline Random Forest Regressor model using the default hyperparameters. Subsequently, we perform feature selection and model tuning to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is the sole evaluation metric used in this project to assess model performance.
